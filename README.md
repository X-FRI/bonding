## Build from source
> This project is built using [xmake](https://xmake.io).

This is currently the only way to use bonding. Fortunately, xmake supports the generation of files required by build tools such as Ninja, CMake and Makefile, so this project supports building from Ninja or CMakes:

1. clone: `git clone https://github.com/muqiuhan/bonding --recurse-submodules --depth=1`
2. and build it: `make build.release` or build for debug: `make build.debug`
    > or use one of cmake and ninja

## Install

- The easiest is `make install`, it will try to request administrator permission to install

Other install options: 
- `xmake -o INSTALLDIR` to set the install directory.
    >
    > e.g. `xmake install -o /usr/local`
    >
    > or   `DESTDIR=/usr/local xmake install`
    >
    > or   `INSTALLDIR=/usr/local xmake install`

- `xmake -g GROUP` to install  all targets of the given group. It support path pattern matching.
    > e.g.   `xmake install -g test`
    > 
    > or     `xmake install -g test_*`
    > 
    > or     `xmake install --group=benchmark/*`

## Debug
Bonding need advanced permissions to create, such as restricting resources through cgroups, restricting system calls through seccomp, etc. So they must be debug with sudo. For example:

```shell
sudo lldb ./build/linux/x86_64/debug/bonding run --debug
```

## USAGE:
```
Usage: bonding [help] [init] [run] [help] [version]

 [init]
        Initialize the current directory as the container directory

 [run]
        Run with the current directory as the container directory

 [help]
        show this message

 [version]
        show the version of bonding
```

Bonding sets the environment and various parameters through the configuration file [bonding.json](./example/bonding.json):
```json
{
    "hostname": "Test",
    "debug": true,
    "uid": 0,
    "mount_dir": "./mount_dir",
    "command": "/bin/bash",
    "mounts": [
        [
            "/lib",
            "/lib"
        ],
        [
            "/lib64",
            "/lib64"
        ]
    ],
    "clone": [
        "CLONE_NEWNS",
        "CLONE_NEWCGROUP",
        "CLONE_NEWPID",
        "CLONE_NEWIPC",
        "CLONE_NEWNET",
        "CLONE_NEWUTS"
    ],
    "cgroups-v1": {
        "cpu.shares": "256",
        "pids.max": "64",
        "blkio.bfq.weight": "64",
        "memory.limit_in_bytes": "1073741824"
    }
}
```

- `mount_dir` is the root directory where the container runs
- `mounts` is the external directory that the container needs to mount
- `command` is the path and arguments to the application running inside the container
- `clone` is the process running command CLONE_FLAG, see [man clone](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html)
- `cgroups-v1` is used to limit the resources of the container, see [Control Groups Version 1](https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/cgroup-v1/index.html)
