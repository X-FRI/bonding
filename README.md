# Bonding

*A Minimalism container implementation in C++*

</div>

## Build from source
> This project is built using [xmake](https://xmake.io).

This is currently the only way to use bonding. Fortunately, xmake can solve most of the build problems, so don't hesitate to use it!

Bonding's [xmake.lua](./xmake.lua) will automatically generate Ninja, Makefile, CMake, Visual Studio project files, and Xcode project files after the first build, and you can also generate other builds directly through it before using xmake to build this project Tool related files:

```e
xmake project -k ninja
xmake project -k cmake
xmake project -k make
xmake project -k vs
xmake project -k xcode
```

1. clone the source: `git clone https://github.com/muqiuhan/bonding --recurse-submodules`
2. build it: `xmake f -m release && xmake build` or build for debug: `xmake f -m debug && xmake build`

## Install

- The easiest is `xmake install --admin`, it will try to request administrator permission to install

Other install options: 
- `xmake -o INSTALLDIR` to set the install directory.
    >
    > e.g. `xmake install -o /usr/local`
    >
    > or   `DESTDIR=/usr/local xmake install`
    >
    > or   `INSTALLDIR=/usr/local xmake install`

- `xmake -g GROUP` to install  all targets of the given group. It support path pattern matching.
    > e.g.   `xmake install -g test`
    > 
    > or     `xmake install -g test_*`
    > 
    > or     `xmake install --group=benchmark/*`

## Debug
Bonding need advanced permissions to create, such as restricting resources through cgroups, restricting system calls through seccomp, etc. So they must be debug with sudo. For example:

```shell
sudo lldb ./build/linux/x86_64/debug/bonding run --debug
```

## USAGE:
```
sage: ./build/linux/x86_64/debug/bonding [-h,--help] [init] [run]

 [init]
        Initialize the current directory as the container directory

 [run]
        Run with the current directory as the container directory
```

- `-h --hostname`: If the hostname is not explicitly provided, bonding will randomly generate a random hostname, with a length of 10, consisting of English uppercase and lowercase letters and numbers, e.g `bonding.0wusbvmdos`.

- `-m --mounts`: If no additional mount path is explicitly provided, two system dynamic library directories will be mounted by default: `/lib64`, `/lib`.

Bonding sets the environment and various parameters through the configuration file [bonding.json](./example/bonding.json):
```json
{
    "hostname": "Test",
    "debug": true,
    "uid": 0,
    "mount_dir": "./mount_dir",
    "command": "/bin/bash",
    "mounts": [
        [
            "/lib",
            "/lib"
        ],
        [
            "/lib64",
            "/lib64"
        ]
    ]
}
```
